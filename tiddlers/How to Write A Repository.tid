title: How to Write A Repository
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Here's a [[Programming]] technique that I use on my personal projects, and would love to try on a team that was willing to experiment with it: [[Phil Cal√ßado]] on [[How To Write A Repository|https://philcalcado.com/2010/12/23/how_to_write_a_repository.html]]

Instead of the usual naming:

```
class OrderRepository {
List<Order> getOrdersFor(Account a){...}
}
```

Name the classes and methods like this:

```
class AllOrders {
List<Order> belongingTo(Account a){...}
}
```

This kind of naming is fluent to read and write, and makes it easy to spot when there's a method that wouldn't be appropriate on a 'list of Order objects'.
